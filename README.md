# sequence-alignment
Python program to perform multiple sequence analysis on CDR3 sequences

A list of updates/ upgrades that need to be built into the code:
  
  i) a dictionary to sort the pairwise values and output the desired number
  
  ii) changes need to be made to createDF() to not subset data
  
  iii) potential upgrades to visualization
